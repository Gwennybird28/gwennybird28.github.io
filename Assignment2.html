<h1>Why are protected areas important? </h1> 
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"> Protected areas throughout the world perform many functions. <br> 
They are essential for conserving biodiversity, and for delivering vital ecosystem services, such as protecting watersheds and soils and shielding human communities from natural disasters. </h3>

    <p>Why recycle plastic: High-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic has better and 
      higher resistance which helps in withstanding rough handling. 
      This has many other advantages apart from being recyclable, stability and strong. 
      We all know the importance of recycling and the benefits of plastic pallets.
       So do take an environmentally friendly decision which is also lighter on your pocket. 
      Make sure to recycle the plastic waste, so that it gets converted into something useful.   </p>

    <p> Ways to Conserve Land - We acquire additional properties to strategically expand our nature reserve system.
       Your gift of land or the funds to manage and expand the system will protect species at risk, provincially 
       imperiled habitats and globally-recognized sites. Our nature reserves are given 
      by people who love nature, cared for by people who love nature and owned forever by members of Ontario Nature. </p>

    Human Health -watershed provides safe drinking water, food, enables us to adapt to the impacts of climate change by
     cooling the air and absorbing greenhouse gas emissions, and provides natural areas for people to keep active.
      Conservation Ontario is a partner of EcoHealth Ontario. <br>
      Ecological Health - watershed conserves water, promotes streamflow, 
      supports sustainable streams, rivers, lakes, and groundwater
      sources, enables healthy soil for crops and livestock, 
      and provides habitat for wildlife and plants.
    <li class="mainli1"> <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/national-wildlife-areas/protected-conserved-areas-database.html" target="_blank"> Visit Canada's Protected Areas</a></li>
    <p> The geospatial data can be used with GIS software or Google Earthâ„¢. It contains combined data from all Canadian jurisdictions. It is used by a wide range of organizations, 
      including governments, ENGOs, academia, land managers, industry, and the public.</p>
    <li class="mainli1"> <a href="https://www.nature.org/en-us/what-we-do/our-priorities/protect-water-and-land/" target="_blank" > Visit The Nature Conservancy </a></li>
    <p> We are facing dual threats with the climate crisis and extreme loss of biodiversity, and we need clean water and healthy lands.
      In the next decade, we're working to protect ourselves and our planet by conserving 650 million hectares of healthy land, 
      30 million hectares of freshwater, and 4 billion hectares of oceans. Through protected areas, sustainable fishing,
      forest management, and working with Indigenous peoples,
      we're taking action to shape a better future for people and the planet.</p>

    <p> As you go about your everyday life, there are several small behaviors that you can do to help protect the planet. 
      It all starts with awareness. Once you become aware of your impact, you learn why it is essential to take action. 
      Your actions will likely influence those around you. Most of the steps we will mention below benefit the environment and you. 
      For example, bringing reusable bags to the store helps avoid plastic pollution.
